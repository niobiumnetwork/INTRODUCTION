# INTRODUCTION
Web 3.0 is a term used to describe the next generation of the internet.
In theory, it will run on verifiable digital ledgers called blockchains and provide users with a truly decentralized network.
In order for this grand idea to come to fruition, however, different blockchains must be able to exchange data and digital assets.
That’s where blockchain interoperability comes in. By devising ways to connect different blockchains, engineers can build an interconnected Web 3.0 ecosystem.
In this article, you’ll learn how this new technology is evolving — and how it could change the world.
